    <p>My name is Jordan and I come from an Italian family. If you know anything about Italian families, it’s that we talk with our hands and we LOVE food. Especially homecooked meals.  

    Growing up, my grandmother had an open-door policy at her house. Her front door was always unlocked and if you wanted to go visit her, you let yourself in. One of the first questions she would ask you was “Have you eaten?” And no matter what your answer was, she would go and set out whatever she had in the fridge to make you a plate.</p> <br>

    <p>Some days she had pasta with her homemade sugo (pasta sauce), other days she had chop suey made with pork tenderloin and chicken. Polenta concia, vegetable soup, chicken stew, biscotti, pizzelle. The list goes on and thank goodness that it does because I do not understand how people survive without this kind of food around. If you’re going to eat, eat the good stuff! </p>
    
   
    <p>Most of these meals are great for any day; they last several days and some of them are big enough to feed you all week. </p></div>
