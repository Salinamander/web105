    <p>My grandma has told me that growing up, they had a salad every single day. And veggies were served alongside or incorporated into every meal. We do that now as well, that’s how I was raised. We will eat meat on occasion but nobody can deny that we love our veggies. </p>
    
    <div><p><h3>Eggplant Casserole</h3>
        Eggplant is one of my favorite vegetables because of this dish. It's warm and inviting and hearty. We usually have this one on Christmas and Easter. We would have it on Thanksgiving too if it weren't for that turkey.</p>
       <p>4 to 5 eggplants <br>
        Eggs, beaten and flour for breading the eggplant <br>
        1lb potatoes, peeled, boiled and sliced <br>
        Your favorite pasta sauce <br>
        Mozzarella cheese <br>

    <p>Peel and slice the eggplant the day before or at least a few hours before you need it. Sprinkle it with salt and let it sit in the fridge. After they've sat, prepare your flour and eggs. Heat some corn oil on the stove in a pan. You know it's hot enough when you take some water on your fingers and lightly splash the oil and it reacts. <br>
    Dip the eggplant in the egg until fully coated and then coat it in the flour. Fry each slice until it is lightly golden brown. Don't over cook it in the oil, it will bake in the oven. <br>
    Once the eggplant is all fried, you start layering the ingredients in a dish to bake. Start with sauce at the very bottom and layer potatoes and eggplant until it's to the top. Top the entire casserole in sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese. <br>
    Bake at 350 in an oven safe baking dish until the cheese on top is melted and browned and the entire dish is heated through, about 40 min.</p>

    <div><p><h3>Vegetable Soup</h3>
        The second fall hits, it's soup season. Warm soup filled with veggies with a hunk of hard bread season. <br> Everyone gathers around the table with a big bowl of this soup whenever we have it waiting on the stove. And even though we're all there together, we're too busy slurping this soup down to talk about the impending winter. <br>
        <p>4 tbs butter <br>
            6 carrots <br>
            6 stalks of celery <br> 
            2 medium onions, diced <br>
            1-3 cloves garlic, to your taste <br>
            1/2 head of cabbage <br>
            1 can of crushed tomatoes <br>
            2 zucchini <br>
            2 cans of beans, your choice <br>
            2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce <br>
            Oregano to taste <br>
            Pepper to taste <br>    
            1 carton of veggie or chicken stock <br>
            1 big bag of fresh spinach <br>
            8 cups water <br>

            <p>Add the butter and carrots to a stock pot and cook until they’re soft. Add everything else in and let it cook through. Make sure the veggies are tender! The zucchini will take the longest, so make sure to check those. It will take about an hour. </p>
        </p></div>

         <div><p><h3>Mom's Bean Salad</h3> 
            This dish is so simple and so good, it's become a staple at all of the major family gatherings. It started as my mom's recipe and soon everyone else wanted it as well. You can use any bean you'd like, canned or otherwise. I prefer to use kidney, black, garbanzo, green and wax beans.<br></p>
            <p>3 cups of white vinegar <br>
                3 cups of sugar <br>
                1 large onion, sliced very thin <br>
                Mayonnaise <br>
                Your choice of beans, approximately 1-2 cans of each. You'll need about 10 cans total. <br>

                <p>Heat the vinegar in a pot on the stove until it begins to simmer. Add the sugar and cook until it all dissolves. <br>
                Dump all of your beans into a large bowl and pour the vinegar mixture over it. The amount of vinegar and sugar depends solely on how much you want to make. You only need it to cover the beans completely, so if you need less than 3 cups of vinegar and sugar, that's fine. Let them sit overnight. <br>
                Once the beans have set, strain them. DO NOT rinse them. Add one big spoonful of mayonnaise, just enough to cover the beans. Then go ahead and add your sliced onion. Stir it up and enjoy!</p>
