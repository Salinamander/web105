        So, I’m not one to shy away from sweets but I do have a limit. Some cakes and frostings have so much sugar they make the roof of my mouth tingle and I’m left with a terrible headache. <br> This is not one of those cakes. This one is delectable. It’s definitely on my top 10 list and it’s got so many good things in it that I don’t feel bad keeping it around. Make sure you use the good olive oil for this one. <br></p>
        <p>1 cup good olive oil <br>
            2 cups flour <br>
            1 tsp kosher salt <br>
            1 tsp baking powder <br>
            1/4 tsp baking soda <br>
            1 1/2 cup sugar <br>
            3 eggs, room temp <br>
            1 tbsp lemon zest <br>
            2 tbsp lemon juice <br>
            1 1/4 cup whole milk <br></p>
        
        <p>Preheat the oven to 375 and grease and flour a 9” round baking pan with olive oil. Beat the sugar, eggs and zest until they’re fluffy. Whisk together all of the dry ingredients.  Leave the mixer running and slowly add in the olive oil and mix until it is fully incorporated. It will take about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and add the milk and lemon juice. Add the flour gradually until it is fully combined. Transfer to a pan and sprinkle the top with about 2 tbsp of sugar.  Bake for 40-45 minutes.  </p></div>
    
        <div class="ingredients"><p><h3>Pecan Meltaways</h3>
        These cookies are great for year-round treats but I associate them with the holidays. They look like perfectly round little snowballs and they're great for sharing with family. <br></p>
        <p>2 sticks butter <br>
            5 tbsp powdered sugar <br>
            1 tsp vanilla <br>
            1 3/4 cup flour <br>
            1/2 cup chopped pecans <br></p>
        <p>Combine the ingredients and beat for a full 5 minutes. <br>
        Scoop into 1 tbsp scoops and bake for 10 minutes at 350. Make sure you don't overbake them. <br>
        When they're done baking, let them cool and roll them in powdered sugar.</p> </div>
    
       <div class="ingredients"><p><h3>Pound Cake</h3>
    This one is another of my mom's recipes. It's fantastic dusted with a little powdered sugar or with nothing at all on top. I've also used it to make the lamb cake for easter and it worked out in the lamb mold. This is a very rich cake, so even though my family takes little slivers at a time, it never lasts longer than a few days.</p> 
        <p>3 sticks butter, room temperature <br>
            1 package of cream cheese, room temperature <br>
            3 cups sugar <br>
            dash of salt <br>
            1/2 tsp vanilla <br>
            3 cups flour <br>
            6 eggs, room temperature</p>
        <p>Cream the butter, cream cheese and sugar until it is fluffy. <br>
        Add salt and vanilla and beat well. Add he eggs one at a time, then slowly add he flour. Beat until smooth and bake in a greased and floured bundt pan at 325 for 90 minutes.</p></div>
